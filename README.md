Brief Description:

The AddItUp function sums as many numbers as a user desires and then outputs
the Total of those numbers, the NumNumbers (number of numbers), and the 
numbers that were entered.

In-Depth Description:

The AddItUp function prompts the user if they would like enter a number. If 
anything other than a number is entered you will be given a message 
starting, "Please enter a number this time." After the message if given, there 
will be an immediate prompting of entering a number once again. Once the user 
enters a number, then the function asks the user if they would like to enter
another number. The user must enter yes or no, or else they will be informed to, 
"Please answer yes or no." Once again, the user will be prompted again if they
would like to enter another number, where they should the answer yes or no. 
If they user says yes, they will continue inputting numbers until they respond
"no" to the request to enter another number. Once a user inputs "no," then
the AddItUp function outputs the Total of those numbers, the NumNumbers 
(number of numbers), and the numbers that were entered.
